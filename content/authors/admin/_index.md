Hi! I'm currently a Second Year Ph.D student at UC Berkeley, where I'm advised by [Sanjit Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/), and gratefully supported by the [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, programming languages, and formal methods. More specifically, I focus primarily on _program synthesis_ and _trustworthy AI_. Specifically, I'm motivated by the following questions: First, how can we use machine learning to help users build programmatic tools more efficiently? And second, how can we use techniques from formal methods to make learning-driven systems safer to use, especially in safety-critical scenarios?

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Rice University, where I worked on projects related to interpretable machine learning via program synthesis and formal methods. I was advised by [Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/), who I worked with on the ["Understanding the World Through Code" NSF Expeditions Project](http://www.neurosymbolic.org/kickoff.html). As an undergrad, I also collaborated with [Ankit Patel](https://ankitlab.co/) and [Richard Baraniuk](https://richb.rice.edu/). I was fortunate to be supported by the [Rice CS Graduate Fellowship](https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/advising/fifth-year-masters).

I've also spent time at Microsoft Research AI, where I worked with Alex Polozov and the [GRAIL group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/grounded-reasoning-and-interactive-learning-grail/) on interactive ML-driven program synthesis. I am currently collaborating with Jon DeCastro and [TRI](https://www.tri.global/) to help roboticists write better tests.

In my free time, I enjoy doing a lot of things, including but not limited to: playing tennis, writing subpar poetry, cooking, and repeatedly fixing and breaking my jumpshot. I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and I love watching my beloved Cavaliers and Browns break my heart year after year.
